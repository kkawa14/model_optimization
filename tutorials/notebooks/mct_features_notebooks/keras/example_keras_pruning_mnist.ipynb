    "### Attention\n",
    "\n",
    "The MCT (Model Compression Toolkit) used in this tutorial requires TensorFlow 2.15 or earlier, which are not compatible with the default Google Colab environment (Python 3.12 or later).\n",

    "## Overview\n",
    "This tutorial provides a step-by-step guide to training, pruning, and finetuning a Keras fully connected neural network model using the Model Compression Toolkit (MCT). We will start by building and training the model from scratch on the MNIST dataset, followed by applying structured pruning to reduce the model size.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary\n",
    "In this tutorial, we will cover:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Training a Keras model on MNIST:** We'll begin by constructing a basic fully connected neural network and training it on the MNIST dataset. \n",
    "2. **Applying structured pruning:** We'll introduce a pruning technique to reduce model size while maintaining performance. \n",
    "3. **Finetuning the pruned model:** After pruning, we'll finetune the model to recover any lost accuracy. \n",
    "4. **Evaluating the pruned model:** We'll evaluate the pruned model’s performance and compare it to the original model.\n",

We demonstrated how to define resource constraints, apply pruning based on channel importance, and evaluate the impact on model architecture and performance. Finally, we showed how finetuning can recover the pruned model’s accuracy. This approach highlights the effectiveness of structured pruning for reducing model size while maintaining performance, making it a powerful tool for model optimization."
