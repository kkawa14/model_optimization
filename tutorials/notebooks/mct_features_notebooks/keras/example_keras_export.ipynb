    "### Attention\n",
    "\n",
    "The MCT (Model Compression Toolkit) used in this tutorial requires TensorFlow 2.15 or earlier, which are not compatible with the default Google Colab environment (Python 3.12 or later).\n",
    "\n",
    "**If you are running this tutorial on Google Colab, you must change the runtime type to use Python 3.11 before proceeding.**  \n",
    "For detailed instructions, please refer to the [README.md](../../../README.md).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "This tutorial demonstrates how to export a Keras model to `.keras` and TFLite formats using the Model Compression Toolkit (MCT). It covers the steps of creating a simple Keras model, applying post-training quantization (PTQ) using MCT, and then exporting the quantized model to `.keras` and TFLite. The tutorial also shows how to use the exported model for inference.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary\n",
    "In this tutorial, we will cover:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Constructing a simple Keras model for demonstration purposes.\n",
    "2. Applying post-training quantization to the model using the Model Compression Toolkit.\n",
    "3. Exporting the quantized model to the `.keras` and `TFLite` formats.\n",
